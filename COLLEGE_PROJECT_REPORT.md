## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 E-commerce Evolution

E-commerce has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1990s. According to Turban et al. (2018), e-commerce represents the buying and selling of products and services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks.

### 2.2 Web Development Technologies

**PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor):**
PHP remains one of the most popular server-side scripting languages for web development. According to W3Techs (2024), PHP is used by 76.8% of all websites with known server-side programming languages.

**MySQL Database:**
MySQL is widely adopted for web applications due to its reliability, performance, and ease of use. It supports ACID transactions and provides excellent scalability options.

**Responsive Web Design:**
Marcotte (2010) introduced the concept of responsive web design, emphasizing the importance of creating websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### 2.3 E-commerce Security

Security in e-commerce applications is crucial for protecting sensitive customer data. Common security measures include:
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
- Secure session management
- Data encryption and validation

### 2.4 Related Work

Several e-commerce platforms exist in the market:
- **Shopify:** Cloud-based e-commerce platform
- **WooCommerce:** WordPress-based e-commerce plugin
- **Magento:** Open-source e-commerce platform
- **OpenCart:** PHP-based e-commerce solution

This project draws inspiration from these platforms while implementing custom features tailored for electronics retail.
