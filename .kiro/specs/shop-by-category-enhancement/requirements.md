# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing "Shop by Category" section on the homepage to align with the actual product categories used throughout the site and provide seamless navigation to specific category sections on the product page. The current homepage shows generic categories (smartphones, laptops, accessories, smartwatches) while the product page uses different categories (Mobile, Laptop, Keyboard and Mouse, Headphones, Accessories). This enhancement will create consistency and improve user experience by allowing users to click category buttons and jump directly to the corresponding category section on the product page.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the homepage THEN the system SHALL display category buttons for Mobile, Laptop, Keyboard and Mouse, Headphones, and Accessories
2. WHEN a user views the category section THEN each category button SHALL display an appropriate icon and description
3. WHEN a user views the category buttons THEN they SHALL be visually consistent with the existing design theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer interested in a specific product category, I want to click on a category button and be taken directly to that category's section on the product page, so that I can quickly find relevant products without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Mobile" category button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product page and scroll to the Mobile category section
2. WHEN a user clicks on the "Laptop" category button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product page and scroll to the Laptop category section

5. WHEN a user clicks on the "Accessories" category button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product page and scroll to the Accessories category section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer navigating between category sections, I want smooth scrolling and proper positioning when I arrive at a category section, so that I have a pleasant browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a category button THEN the system SHALL use smooth scrolling animation to the target section
2. WHEN the page scrolls to a category section THEN the system SHALL position the section header properly below the navigation bar
3. WHEN a user arrives at a category section THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate the active section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer using the category navigation, I want the category buttons to work consistently whether I'm already on the product page or coming from another page, so that the navigation behavior is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a category button from the homepage THEN the system SHALL navigate to the product page and scroll to the correct category section
2. WHEN a user clicks a category button while already on the product page THEN the system SHALL scroll to the correct category section without page reload
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons after category navigation THEN the system SHALL maintain proper scroll position and page state
