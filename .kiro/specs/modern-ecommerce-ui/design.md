# Design Document

## Overview

The modern dark-themed e-commerce UI will transform the existing CosmicCart website into a premium electronics store interface. The design leverages the current cosmic theme while shifting focus to electronics products with enhanced visual hierarchy, improved product presentation, and modern UI patterns. The interface will maintain the existing dark theme foundation while introducing electronics-specific design elements and improved user experience patterns.
