# This is a placeholder for product images
# In a real implementation, you would place actual .jpg, .png, or .webp image files here
# For now, the website will show broken image icons, but the functionality will work
# 
# Sample image filenames referenced in the database:
# - laptop.jpg
# - phone.jpg  
# - headphones.jpg
# - watch.jpg
# - tablet.jpg
# - camera.jpg
